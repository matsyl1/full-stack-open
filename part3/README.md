As per course recommendation - all code for part 3 can be found in this dedicated repo: https://github.com/matsyl1/full-stack-open-phonebook

In this part - created a backend for the phonebook frontend developed in part 2 using Express. Backend stores data in MongoDB Atlas and the entire app is deployed on Render: https://full-stack-open-test-part3.onrender.com/.
